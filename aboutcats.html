Our Founders:
</h2>
<h3>
    Elijah "QuadrupleDeepfriedCheeseSteak"
</h3>
<p>
Elijah got the idea for the IEatCats while on the bus to
school while talking with the now co-founder, Anthony, About
how he felt like the cat-eaters of America needed their
own website to connect with their brothers. This is
how IEatCats.io was born.
</p>
<h3>
Anthony "Fortnite747"
</h3>
<p>
Anthony is the gem of the cat-eater community. With his great autistic energy, he 
can single handedly annoy an entire room of people.
