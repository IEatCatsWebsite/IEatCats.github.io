<h2>QNA 5 / 3 / 24</h2>
<h3>Dogs?</h3>
<p>
This question comes from Quintuple-Super-Sized-Mega-Monster-Francisco-Aldevarra-James. He asks: "I eat dogs. Am I allowed in?"
While we are partly united in the sense of eating usually forbidden flesh, Cat-eating and Dog-eating are different. You may
still view our page of course, but you cannot become an exclusive member if you eat dog meat but not cat meat. If you eat both or just
cat meat, we can continue to review your character and decide if you are a fit for an exclusive member. As for the fanclub, I am having difficulties
in finding ways to make this custom content. When this time arrises though, you will see more info on the fanclub page.

I've finally gotten to making this page, but there is one glaring issue.
There are no submissions! Please, if you have any questions or want to share
anything with the cat-eating community, please email us!
