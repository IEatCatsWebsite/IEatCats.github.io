<h3>Consider this: Switzerland</h3>
<p>
Hello Cat-eaters. This is Elijah with our first piece of truly cat-eating related news. According to Fodor's Travel Guide and Wikipedia,
  It is completly legal in Switzerland to eat cats as long as you own them. If you are seeking refuge in any country as a Cat-eater,
  you should <em>ALWAYS</em> keep this in mind. Stay safe, stay hungry.
