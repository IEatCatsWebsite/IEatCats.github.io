This is where Anthony and I write about our random ideas and random events as well as things
that we think are just interesting. Enjoy!

The site is finished!
</h3>
<p>
Hey Cat-eaters, the site is really finally finished and live. I expected to be much harder to do than it really is, it was really easy actually.
  The hardest part about putting up this website was getting it to run on Github servers. I had to keep deleting stuff and looking stuff up
  and trying different things but I finally got it up. Also, I should mention the reason QNAs and Fanclub is down is because of some
  technical issues with google. I also can't upload videos because of it so in the mean time, I'll just write these blogs and the news.
  Again I hope that the website works out, and also that people actually keep using this site. Just keeping checking in every
  once in a while and your bound to find something interesting.
</p>

I'm tired

As I am writing this, the page is actually still not finished but it is 10:46 pm
and I am really tired. I will probably finish the site in about 2 days from now.
